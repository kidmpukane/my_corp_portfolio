            Kare is a full-stack, ML-powered skincare app that empowers users to
            make informed choices about their skin health. By allowing users to
            input detailed skincare routines, products, and goals, Kare analyzes
            trends, detects inconsistencies, and suggests evidence-backed
            improvements. Unlike generic skincare tools, Kare adapts to
            real-world data and evolves with each interaction. The app was built
            to explore how real-time feedback, behavior tracking, and
            lightweight machine learning models can be used to personalize
            health-related guidance â€” all within a user-friendly mobile
            experience.
